# Monitor

Monitor is a tool that displays your cryptocurrency balances in a formatted table with customizable colors and optional integration with Google Sheets.

## Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the Monitor tool up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Clone the Project to Your Local Machine

Open your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/unyeco/monitor.git

```

### 2. Copy Configuration Files and Update with Your Details

#### Copy `keys-example.json` to `keys.json`

Copy the example keys file:

```bash

Open `keys.json` in your preferred text editor and replace the placeholder values with your own API keys.

#### Copy `config-example.json` to `config.json` (Optional, for Google Sheets integration)

Copy the example configuration file:

```bash
cp config-example.json config.json
```

Open `config.json` and update the configuration. Specifically:
- Set `"enabled": true` under the `googleAPI` section if you want to use Google Sheets integration.
- Replace `"credentialsPath"` with the path to your Google service account credentials file (see Step 3 below).
- Replace `"accountEmail"` with the email of the Google account to share the sheet with.
